   Implemented a predictive analytics project aimed at forecasting machine failure based on user inputs. Leveraged various machine learning techniques including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) to develop predictive models‚Äù., 
Introduction:
Machine failure forecasting is critical in various industries to prevent costly downtimes and maintenance. Predictive analytics techniques offer a proactive approach to address this challenge. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) in predicting machine failures.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Relevant data on machine health parameters, maintenance records, and historical failure instances were collected.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data underwent preprocessing steps, including cleaning, normalization, and feature selection, to ensure quality and relevance.
Model Development: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) models were trained using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess their predictive performance.
Results:
Graphical Representation: Graphs illustrating the performance of each model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are presented. These visualizations provide a comparative analysis of the models' strengths and weaknesses.
Prediction: Predictions for machine failures generated by each model are provided. The predictions are based on user inputs and are accompanied by confidence scores, indicating the models' confidence levels in their predictions.
Discussion:
Comparative Analysis: The strengths and limitations of each model are discussed based on their performance metrics and prediction outcomes.
Insights: Insights derived from the graphical representations and predictions offer valuable information for stakeholders to make informed decisions regarding maintenance and operational strategies.
Conclusion:
This study demonstrates the applicability of predictive analytics techniques in forecasting machine failures.
Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) exhibit varying degrees of effectiveness in predicting machine failures.
Stakeholders can utilize the insights provided by this study to optimize maintenance schedules and minimize downtimes.
